I've been kind of interested in OR lately, especially the optimization aspect, so I think I'm going to try and branch out and study it a bit. This repo will serve as a place to play around with some OR tools.

I have some [notes](./docs/notes.md) I'm using to keep track of what I've learned - maybe I'll convert them into a blog post someday...
